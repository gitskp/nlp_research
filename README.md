In this repository I will be hosting all my paper reviews and summaries for the latest and most intersting natural language processing (NLP) research. The idea is to present interesting and novel NLP research in a way that is *transferable* to the wider audience, catering for beginner researchers and those in interdisciplinary fields. This includes researchers new to the field of NLP and deep learning and also those from other fields such as linguistics and nueroscience. In addition, I emphasize on several ideas and future research directions, which could be very useful for upcoming researchers who need a new topic to work on.
